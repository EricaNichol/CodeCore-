this file is written in Markdown. Markdown is pretty easy, put I still forget some of the syntax, sometimes... like how to make tables, and I always need to look up how to insert images!

Fortunately, Markdown is small, and we can reference a [cheetsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

##Command Line Commands
We can also syntax highlight code in blocks using backticks.
''''
pwd
ls
whoami
mkdir lol_dir
touch my_file.rb
rm my_file.rb
cd..
rm -r lol_dir # use 'rm -rf <dir-name>' if you want to forcibily, recursively, remove stuff.

##git
We can use git to track revision history for our projects. Simply by typing "git init" within a directory, we are able to track of every change that happens!
